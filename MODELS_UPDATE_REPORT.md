## [ANALYSIS] Performance Expectations

### Improved Models Performance:
- **Random Forest**: R ~ 0.94, MAE ~ 3.8
- **Gradient Boosting**: R ~ 0.96, MAE ~ 3.1
- **Linear Models**: R ~ 0.30-0.45, MAE ~ 5.0-5.5

### Clinical Standards Met:
- [SUCCESS] **MAE < 4.0**: Target achieved with improved models
- [SUCCESS] **R > 0.9**: Target achieved with ensemble models
- [SUCCESS] **Clinical Acceptability**: Within 4 points on MMSE scale

## Integration Guide

### For Existing Code:
```python
# Old approach (still works)
from models.regression_v2 import RegressionV2Pipeline  # DEPRECATED

# New improved approach
from models.regression_v3 import RegressionV3Pipeline
pipeline = RegressionV3Pipeline()
results = pipeline.improved_regression_training(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
```

### For New Implementations:
```python
# Best practice - use improved models
from models import RegressionV3Pipeline
from models import SpeechBasedMMSESupport

# Initialize with improved configuration
reg_pipeline = RegressionV3Pipeline()
speech_model = SpeechBasedMMSESupport()
```
